# Electronic-Flight-Planner
Useful collection of tools for pilots! (ICAO - Brazil)

This program was created to help pilots in their pre-flight planning.
It currently includes real time weather and forecast (in aviation/ICAO standards) provided by brazilian agency 
DECEA - Department of Airspace Control, through APIs. It is also possible to calculate weight and balance of an aircraft 
Cessna CJ3 model and see the results in a graph chart which displays center of gravity limits and its plots regarding
each phase of flight.
Further improvements will implement complete aeronautical information, notice to airmen and flight planning, as well as 
exportable documents in PDF files along with automated forms sent via email in order to help pilots keep their registry.
